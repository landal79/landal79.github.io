The first thing we learn as we approach computer science are algorithms,
there are various definition of algorithms but I like the [merriam-webster](http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/algorithm){:target="_blank"} one:

> a procedure for solving a mathematical problem (as of finding the greatest common divisor) in a finite number of steps that frequently involves repetition of an operation; broadly :  a step-by-step procedure for solving a problem or accomplishing some end especially by a computer

I would like to highlight the word **problem**, so programming is about problem solving.
In my opinion problem solving include two parts:
- Understanding the problem
- Solving the problem

According to [Problem Solving for Software Engineers][]{:target="_blank"} there are four phases:

>- Understanding the problem
>- Devising the plan
>- Carrying out the plan
>- Retrospection

### Understanding the problem
It may seem obvious that in order to be able to solve a problem, we have to first understand it. Nothing is farther from reality in the IT business. It is not uncommon in my profession to see entire applications and architectures flawed and crippled by initial misunderstandings of a problem or requirement. While spending time to deeply understand what we have to build may not sound like the most ‘agile’ thing to do, the price to pay for a faulty start could be quite high.

### Improve problem solving skills

What us as developers should do, it's to improve a little our problem solving skills everyday.

There are a multitude of way to improve problem solving skills as:

- randomly try something
- read random articles/blogs/posts about the topic I am concerned with (or a closely connected topic)
- making a nice drawing
- split the problem into multiple but simpler problems (The never died **divide and conquer technique**)
- do something else
- Google something that is related in some way to the problem
- talk to others about the problem
- make a TODO list
- write down stuff you know about the problem's effect so you can more easily find patterns
